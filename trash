4. To check if all rpms required for samba are installed or not.
 #rpm –qa | grep samba, then it displays the following Samba-<version-name> Samba-common-<version-name> Samba-client-<version- name> System-config-samba-<version-name>
5. If not, install it using #rpm –ivh samba
6. Copy the original configuration file as smb.conf.bck
#cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba.conf.bck
(This will keep a backup copy of your configuration file.)

[homes]
comment=Home directories browseable =no writable=yes
